# dockerfiles
@bombnp's Personal collection of custom Docker images. Feel free to use them as you see fit.

### TODOs / Ideas
- [ ] Use templates for building similar images with different base image tags or target image tags. For example. `bombnp/latex-basic-2024-python` follows the same tag as the base `python` image. This would allow us to build  `bombnp/latex-basic-2024-python` images for multiple versions with one Dockerfile template.
